F2PY Sorting Module
################################################

Sort subroutines.

It can be compiled and used by Python using f2py.

The subroutines should be easy enough to reuse in a Fortran only program.

Sort use bubble < 100 length array, and merge for 100 and bigger.

I probably saw the merge subsoutine somewhere else, but I can't remember where.
